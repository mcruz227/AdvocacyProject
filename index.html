  <!--- About --->
  <h2>About Community Building</h2>
  <p>The problem this
    website tackles is that many young people feel left out and disconnected from their communities. This can make it
    tough to find places where we feel like we belong or where we can speak up about what matters to us. But our site is
    all about changing that! It's a cool platform where kids can create their own spaces, share their favorite hangouts,
    chat about local events, and even start projects to make a difference in their communities. It's all about giving
    youth a voice and a place where they feel heard and valued.

    feelings of
    loneliness and disconnection.
